# Adopting Consistent Coding Standards

**Target**: Steadily convert the codebase over to an agreed-upon standard.

**User Story**: As a person responsible for software quality and correctness for my project, I want guidance on selecting and implementing coding standards so that we can make our code easy for everyone to read and understand.

**User Story**: As a software developer on a project that has a defined coding standard, I want tool support so that I am complying with the standards with minimal additional effort or ambiguity.

## Card(s)

### Variant A: How will I measure when I have achieved my desired result?
| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | No coding standard adopted. |
| 1 | Team has selected an agreed-upon standard.      |
| 2 | New code that is written is required to comply with the standard, and the team has conducted a feedback session to assess and revise the standard.      |
| 3 | The team has developed and put into place a refactoring plan to bring pre-existing code into compliance with the standard.      |
| 4 | Tool support has been put in place to help ensure compliance, and running the tool is made part of contribution guidelines.     |

### Variant B: What are the steps (tasks) I need to accomplish to achieve my goal?
| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | No code (intentionally) complies with the standard. |
| 1 | All new code that is written is required to be compliant with the standard.      |
| 2 | All changes to existing code are required to be compliant with the standard.      |
| 3 | 25% of remaining pre-standard code has been refactored to comply with the standard.      |
| 4 | 50% of remaining pre-standard code has been refactored to comply with the standard.     |
| 5 | 75% or more remaining pre-standard code has been refactored to comply with the standard. |
