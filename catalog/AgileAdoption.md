# Agile Adoption

## Target

Team begins with Kanban and adopts additional processes in response to specific team needs.

## User Story

As a project leader, I have heard of teams that have adopted Agile workflows and significant success, and others that have had a very negative experience. Therefore, I want to capture the advantages of Agile without wasting time on unnecessary overhead so that I can improve the productivity of my team.


## Card

| Score         | Description |

| 1 | Kanban and Personal Kanban concepts introduced to team.      |

## Comments

1. Examples of Agile processes include stand-up meetings, additional Kanban board columns, user stories, epic/story/task work breakdowns, etc.
