# Creating Community Policies

## Target

Community software policies (and process for revisin over time)

## User Story

As a developer of a software library, I want to collaborate with others to establish software community policies for our topical area (e.g., numerical software, data/viz software, development tools, etc.) so that we can more effectively enable the combined use of diverse, independent packages and improve software quality.

## Comments

- This card was inspired by the BSSw.io article [What are Interoperable Software Libraries? Introducing the xSDK](https://bssw.io/items/what-are-interoperable-software-libraries-introducing-the-xsdk)
- Once this card is completed, teams are encouraged to loop back to step 2 for further revisions; also possibly pursue a related topic: coordinated release of software packages that are compatible with community software policies |
