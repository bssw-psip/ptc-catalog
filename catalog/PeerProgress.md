# Tracking and Adjusting to Progress in Peer Projects

## Target

According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans. (Sun Tzu)

## User Story

As a group lead,
I need to stay abreast of current and planned developments in related projects,
so that project efforts can adapt to changing circumstances.

## Comments

- Knowing about relevant projects not only prevents re-inventing the wheel, it
can also be a source of new collaborators and increased productivity.

- Tracking peer progress looks different in different disciplines, but is especially
important where software development is involved because of the potential win if
datastructures and API-s can be made inter-operable early on.
