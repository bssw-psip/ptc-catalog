# Developer Documentation

 ## Target

 Create documentation for use by the developers of a software project

 ## User Story

 As an application developer, I want to write developer documentation, so that new developers will find it easier 
 to ramp up and contribute to the code development.

 ## Card

 | 0 | No project documentation exists. |
 | 1 | An initial set of documentation has been created<sup>1,2</sup>. |
 | 2 | Feedback from developers is collected on a regular basis and is used to improve documentation<sup>3</sup>.  |
 | 3 | Scripts and/or auto-documentation tools are used to ensure the documentation is kept up to date. |

 ## Comments

 1. A good method for staring is to investigate what documentation is provided by other contemporary similar projects. 
 Inspired by research results, create a scope of your eventual ideal developer documentation.
 2. Focus on creation of initial set of documentation that is most likely to be used by team members for developer phase 
 (ex: existing bug list, to-do list, brief design document, code-organization description, coding standard documentation, 
 code repository description and rules, testing documentation etc.)
 3. Develop a process to solicit feedback on the developer documentation and incorporate improvements. A fresh-eyes new team member perspective is desirable to understand what critical things are missing
 4. Some documentation tools which may be useful:
    - [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl)
    - [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
    - [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org)
    - [WriteTheDocs](https://www.writethedocs.org)
