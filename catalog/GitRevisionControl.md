# Transitioning to Git Revision Control

**Target**: Transition to using Git for revision control and basic Git usage.

**User Story**: As a software engineer I want to use Git revision control, so that the team is able to achieve consistent productivity.

## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | Current revision control practice, e.g., using Subversion or nothing |
| 1 | Categories of contributors are identified and a time-boxed plan for transitioning to Git is agreed upon |
| 2 | Git contribution workflow is document for each type of contributor |
| 3 | Core project is in one or more Git repositories |
| 4 | All new development is based on Git. Core team and all contributors consistently use Git to contribute to the project |
| 5 | After an initial period, the team assesses their git workflow policies and revises them as necessary (e.g., switching from direct push to pull requests, etc.)


## Comments
- During Step 3, the transition to Git is in progress; some development still relies on an old revision control system, with regular synchronization between repositories.
