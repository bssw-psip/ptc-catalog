## Comments

1. A good method for staring is to investigate what documentation is provided by other contemporary similar projects. 
Inspired by research results, create a scope of your eventual ideal end-user documentation.
2. Focus on creation of initial set of documentation that is most likely to be used by end-users (ex: README, software 
introduction guide, software installation and initial setup testing guide, troubleshooting guide etc.
3. Develop a process to solicit feedback on the user documentation and incorporate improvements.
4. Some documentation tools which be useful:
   - [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl)
   - [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
   - [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org)
   - [WriteTheDocs](https://www.writethedocs.org)
