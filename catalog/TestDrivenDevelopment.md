# Test Driven Development

**Target**: Team transitions from a traditional development process to a test driven development process.

**User Story**: As a project leader, I want a development team to transition from a development process where minimal 
testing is done or tests are added *after* implementing new functionality, to a TDD process so that team productivity 
will be improved.

## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | Little or no functional testing. |
| 1 | Tests are added on an ad-hoc basis after implementation. |
| 2 | Tests are added after the implementation of significant new funcationality.  |
| 3 | Tests are added after the implementation of all new functionality. |
| 4 | Tests for simple functional improvements are written first, code to pass the tests is implemented second. |
| 5 | Tests for all functional improvements are written first, code to pass the tests is implemented second. |

## Comments

1. Although not stricly necessary, TDD is assisted by employing continuous integration (CI). Establishing CI for a project
is assumed to be the topic of a separate PTC.
2. No assumption is made about the state of tests currently provided by the project, or to increase the test coverage of legacy code.
