2. On the Fork, in the catalog directory, create a new file for your card.

![Select Create New File](assets/create_file_button.png)

Copy and paste the content of your card into the dialog box. The file should have a descriptive name with the markdown extension (e.g. SoftwareLicensing.md, PerformanceRegressionTesting.md). Commit the new file to the fork.
